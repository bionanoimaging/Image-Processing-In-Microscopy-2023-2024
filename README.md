## Code
To download the files, we recommend `git`:
```
git clone git@https://github.com/hzarei4/Image-Processing-In-Microscopy-WS2023-24.git
```
Usually via a _git pull_ you can update the code. If anything goes wrong which you can't fix, clone it again to a new folder.


### Julia Installation
Download the recent version 1.8.2 on the [Julia Website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

#### Editor
We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/), especially install the Julia and git plugin for VSCode.

#### Documentation 
Also check out the [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/). It is the best resource for julia because many other pages are outdated.

##### Cheatsheet
There is a [Cheatsheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/) available.

### Activate Environment
Open the downloaded source folder with VSCode.
We are going to use [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) for the notebooks.
Open the Julia REPL:
Try to type:
```julia
julia> using Pluto # type y to install Pluto
 │ Package Pluto not found, but a package named Pluto is available from a registry. 
 │ Install package?
 │   (@v1.8) pkg> add Pluto 
 └ (y/n/o) [y]: y


julia> Pluto.run()

Opening http://localhost:1235/?secret=sdCsckRR in your default browser... ~ have fun!

Press Ctrl+C in this terminal to stop Pluto
```

A browser should open from where you can try to open a notebook.
